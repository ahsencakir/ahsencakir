## About Me  

I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Cybersecurity, and Mobile Development.  
Over the past years, I have actively participated in bootcamps, hackathons, and internships, gaining hands-on experience in AI, machine learning, deep learning, mobile app development, and secure systems.  

On GitHub, I showcase my passion through diverse projects:  
- Blockchain-based voting systems (Voxure)  
- Real-time chat & messaging apps (MockersChat, WhisperApp)  
- Game development with Unity (4daysleft)  
- Practical AI tools (screen-text-translator using OCR & DeepL API)  

My goal is to combine academic knowledge with real-world applications, building impactful solutions that bridge technology and people’s needs.

## Internship Experience  

Technology Operations Intern @ Şekerbank (July – September 2025)  

During my internship, I gained hands-on experience in multiple areas of IT infrastructure, system administration, and networking:  

- Hardware & Networking:  
  - Worked with PC components and setup in the IT depot.  
  - Designed and simulated Cisco Packet Tracer topologies including DHCP, FTP, routing (static, RIP, EIGRP), ACL configuration, and subnetting.  
  - Conducted real device testing with routers & switches, DHCP-based IP assignment, and inter-device communication.  

- Microsoft Systems:  
  - Learned SCCM / MECM for application deployment (MSI & EXE), device vs. user collections, and system authorization.  
  - Hands-on with Windows commands for DHCP/DNS (netsh, ipconfig) and troubleshooting.  

- System Administration & Security:  
  - Explored OSI model, encapsulation, trunking, NAT, load balancing (F5), pools & virtual servers.  
  - Exposure to cybersecurity attacks and enterprise-grade troubleshooting.  

- Banking & Enterprise Platforms:  
  - Worked with DevOps and middleware tools (IBM WebSphere, Bamboo, Bitbucket, NFS, Unix system administration).  
  - Used monitoring & logging tools: Zabbix, Grafana, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Dynatrace, Aternity.  
  - Gained experience in Docker Compose, OpenShift, Firebase Messaging and automation via cron jobs.  
  - Learned about digital banking platforms (VIPSMS, SmartMessage, MVision).  

This internship helped me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world enterprise systems, especially in banking technology operations.
